## Patch Notes

### Unreleased

- Added a hard stop for currency transfer interactions while CurrencySearch is loaded.
- Added a prominent in-chat warning that currency transfer is not currently compatible with CurrencySearch, that we are working on a solution, and that users should disable the addon if they need transfers in the meantime.
- Added the same compatibility warning as a login-time addon message.
- Updated README compatibility messaging to match this temporary limitation.
